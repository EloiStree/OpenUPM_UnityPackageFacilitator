# OpenUPM: Unity Package Facilitator

This tool, which I’ve been using since I created it, is far from perfect—it's messy, unfinished, and untested.  

However, despite its flaws, it has been useful to me.  

It allows you to quickly create packages for the Unity Package Manager and use Git for pushing and pulling when you need to work efficiently.
